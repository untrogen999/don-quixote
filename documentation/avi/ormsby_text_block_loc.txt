List of all blocks of text that have a different structure than paragraphs (poems, stanzas, etc.) that I could find with a comment indicating where they are, for the Ormsby translation.

Since line numbers can change, the first few words of each block of text (and maybe title) and the chapter it appears in are shown instead. Note that using the XPath `//comment()` will automatically say which chapter it appears in, by looking at the position in the XPath results.
Also, I made the numbers at the beginning of each line keep increasing when volume 2 is reached, even though the chapter numbers reset.
