All find and replace expressions are in backticks (`). Don't copy the backticks themselves.

1. Remove extraneous text
	* For volume 1:
		1. Delete lines 19831 to the end of the file, then add two blank lines. Note there are invisible spaces in the lines after line 19830, so delete those as well.
		2. Delete lines 27-2259 and 1-10, in that order, with the first and last lines of the ranges also deleted.
	* For volume 2:
		1. Delete lines 19868 to the end of the file, then add two blank lines. Note there are invisible spaces in the lines after line 19867, so delete those as well.
		2. Delete lines 1-523, with the first and last lines of the ranges also deleted. Note that the info about volume 2 is nearly identical to volume 1, so it doesn't need to be kept.
2. Combine volumes.
	1. Manually copy what's left of volume 2's text and put it at the end of the file for volume 1.
	2. Make sure to save the result to a NEW file instead of overwriting volume 1's source file.
	3. Make sure there are at least a couple blank lines between the end of volume 1's text and the start of chapter I of volume 2.
2. Special/misleading character replacement
	1. Find `&` to replace with `&amp;`.
	2. Find `<` to replace with `&lt;`.
	3. Find `>` to replace with `&gt;`.
	4. Fancy quotes/apostrophes are left as-is for now.
	5. Normalize number of newlines. Find `\n{3,}` to replace with `\n\n`
3. Annotate paragraphs.
	1. Make sure "Dot matches all" is UNCHECKED.
	2. Find `\n{2}(.+)` to replace with `\n\n<para n="X">\1`. This finds the START of every paragraph.
	3. Find `(.+)\n{2}` to replace with `\1</para>\n\n`. This finds the END of every paragraph.
4. Annotate chapter titles and chapter summaries with Clopen strategy.
	1. Make sure "Dot matches all" is CHECKED.
	2. Find `\n{2}<para n="X">CHAPTER ([IVXL]+)\.</para>` to replace the chapter header (with the roman numeral) with `\n</chapter>\n\n<chapter n="X" roman="\1">`.
	3. Find `(<chapter n="X" .+?)\n{2}<para n="X">(.+?)</para>` to replace the chapter titles with `\1\n<title>\2</title>`.
