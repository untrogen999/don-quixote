Basic auto-tagging en-masse.

All find and replace expressions are in backticks (`). Don't copy the backticks themselves.

1. Remove extraneous text
	1. Delete every line after line 19830, then add two blank lines. Note there are invisible spaces in the lines after line 19830, so delete those as well.
	2. Delete lines 1-10 and 27-2259, with the first and last lines of the ranges also deleted.
1. Special/misleading character replacement
	1. Find `&` to replace with `&amp;`.
	2. Find `<` to replace with `&lt;`.
	3. Find `>` to replace with `&gt;`.
	4. Fancy quotes/apostrophes are left as-is for now.
	5. Normalize number of newlines. Find `\n{3,}` to replace with `\n\n`
2. Clopen strategy.
	1. Annotate paragraphs.
		1. Make sure "Dot matches all" is UNCHECKED.
		2. Find `\n{2}(.+)` to replace with `\n\n<para n="X">\1`.
		3. Find `(.+)\n{2}` to replace with `\1</para>\n\n`.
	2. Annotate chapter titles and chapter summaries.
		1. Make sure "Dot matches all" is CHECKED.
		2. Find `\n{2}<para n="X">CHAPTER ([IVXL]+)\.</para>` to replace the chapter header (with the roman numeral) with `\n</chapter>\n\n<chapter n="X" roman="\1">`.
		3. Find `(<chapter n="X" .+?)\n{2}<para n="X">(.+?)</para>` to replace the chapter titles with `\1\n {4}<title>\2</title>`.
